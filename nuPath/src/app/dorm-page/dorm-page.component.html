    <h3>I.M. Pei Residence Halls</h3>
    <p>
        Most first-year students are required to live in the Pei Residential Complex. 
        These three buildings are often referred to as Pei 1st Court, 2nd Court, and 3rd Court.
        <br>
        The Pei residence halls accommodate more than 250 students in double and triple occupancy rooms, 
        each with its own private bathroom. Community kitchen lounges are located in 2nd Court and 3rd Court. 
        A shared laundry room is located in 2nd Court. The outdoor Palm Court around which the rooms are 
        grouped is a focus of New College student life. Pei rooms measure approximately 15' x 15' and some 
        feature covered porches or large balconies. The buildings' clustered construction, communal spaces 
        and orientation around Palm Court afford residents a strong sense of community.
        <br><br>
        Pei 3rd Court is home to the Civitas Living Learning Community. This LLC is a First Year Community
        dedicated to helping new students transition into college life. They hold campus resource workshops,
        team & community building exercises, financial literacy workshops, and more.
